# Update existing deck with keeping statistic

This work is based on the [DPD](https://digitalpalidictionary.github.io/) which is the work in progress and updating regularly. Because of this, time after time may be added or editted some words (for example: the word 'pada' become 'pada 1', because has beed found another meaning of this word in another context). We need time after time remove those duplicated words, which are not existing any more. For this reason we have a field **"Test"**
After you updated your Anki Deck (same way just by double clicking on the latest downloaded file). In **Browse** type:

`"deck:SBS Pāli-English Vocab" -test:2`

It will show all cards which do not have number '2' in field "Test". And you can easily delate all of this old words, by selecting all (**Ctrl + A**) and deleting (**Ctrl + Delete**). 

Now you are up to date.

With every next update this 'test number' will be different.
