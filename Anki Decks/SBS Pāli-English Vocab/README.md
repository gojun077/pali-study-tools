# Update existing deck with keeping statistic

This work is based on the [DPD](https://digitalpalidictionary.github.io/) which is the work in progress and updating regularly. Because of this time after time may be added or editted some words (for example: the word pada become pada 1; Because in other context has beed found another meaning of this word.) To still be up to date and time after time remove this words what not exist any more we have a feld **"Test"**
After you updated your Anki Deck (same way just by double clicking on the latest downloaded file). In **Browse** type:

`"deck:SBS Pāli-English Vocab" -test:2`

It will show all cards which do not have number 2 in feld "Test". And you can peasfully delate all of this old words.

With every next update this number different.
