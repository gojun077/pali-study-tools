# Recommended ways of studying this deck:

1) **Use the order of the Recitation Book.**

- Read analysis of the first chant. 
- Then study words from this chant. 
- After, go to the next chant. 
- Better to go with order of the Recitation Book.

Benefits: you will cover all words consistently.

2) **Study chapter which you are interested.**

Using this method you are at risk to lose some words, because they have been added in order of the Recitation Book, and if the word appear later not always it has been added again.
- Read analysis of the chapter, which you like to study.
- Go to corresponding sub-deck
