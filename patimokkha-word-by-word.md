# Pātimokkha Word By Word - Anki deck

UNDER DEVELOPMENT

This is the Word By Word analysis of the [Dvemātikāpāḷi Chaṭṭha Saṅgāyana edition](https://www.digitalpalireader.online/_dprhtml/index.html?loc=v.6.0.x.x.x.x.t) version of the Pātimokkha

This is a work in progress. Not all Pātimokkha rules have been covered yet, every update new rules are added. So far the pack has coverage until PA 77.

It is recommended to study this pack together with the [Bhikkhu Vibhaṅga](https://suttacentral.net/pitaka/vinaya/pli-tv-vi/pli-tv-bu-vb) and The Bhikkhu Patimokkha - Word by Word Translation by Bhikkhu Ñāṇatusita.
