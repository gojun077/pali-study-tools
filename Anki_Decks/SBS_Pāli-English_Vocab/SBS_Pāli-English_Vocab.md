# Recommended ways of studying this deck:

1) **Use the order of the Recitation Book.**

- Read analysis of the first chant. 
- Then study words from this chant. 
- After, go to the next chant. 
- Better to go with order of the Recitation Book.

Benefits: you will cover all words consistently.

2) **Study chants which you are interested.**

Using this method you are at risk to lose some words, because they have been added in order of the Recitation Book, and if the word appear later not always it has been added again.
- Read analysis of the chant, which you like to study. 
- in Anki go to **Browse**

Now all cards from selected chant will appear in your Anki daily routine. After you finish them, you may repeat the process with another chant and so on.

- If English is not your first language, it is always recommended to translate words to your native language. For this, we have empty field "native". You can feel it. And even with next update, this field still will keep all your info.

# Removing duplicated words

This work is based on the [DPD](https://digitalpalidictionary.github.io/) which is the work in progress and updating regularly. Because of this, time after time may be added or edited some words (for example: the word 'pada' become 'pada 1', because has been found another meaning of this word in another context). We need time after time to remove those duplicated words, which are not existing any more. For this reason, we have a field **"Test"**
After you updated your Anki Deck (same way, just by double-clicking on the latest downloaded file). In **Browse** type:

`"deck:SBS Pāli-English Vocab" -test:2`

It will show all cards which do not have number '2' in field "Test". And you can easily delate all of this old words, by selecting all (**Ctrl + A**) and deleting (**Ctrl + Delete**). 

With every next update this 'test number' will be different.
