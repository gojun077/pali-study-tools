<h1>Update existing deck with keeping statistic</h1>
<p>This work is based on the <a href="https://digitalpalidictionary.github.io/">DPD</a> which is the work in progress and updating regularly. Because of this, time after time may be added or edited some words (for example: the word 'pada' become 'pada 1', because has been found another meaning of this word in another context). We need time after time to remove those duplicated words, which are not existing any more. For this reason, we have a field <strong>"Test"</strong>
After you updated your Anki Deck (same way, just by double-clicking on the latest downloaded file). In <strong>Browse</strong> type:</p>
<p><code>"deck:DHP vocab" -test:</code>89</p>
<p>It will show all cards which do not have number '89' in field "Test". And you can easily delate all of this old words, by selecting all (<strong>Ctrl + A</strong>) and deleting (<strong>Ctrl + Delete</strong>). </p>
<p>Now you are up-to-date.</p>
<p>With every next update, this 'test number' will be different.</p>
<ul>
<li>If English is not your first language, it is always recommended to translate words to your native language. For this, we have empty field "native". You can feel it. And even with next update, this field still will keep all your info.</li>
</ul>
